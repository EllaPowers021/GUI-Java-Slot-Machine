# Java-Slot-Machine
A 3 reeled slot machine with save functionality.

<p>This GUI Slot Machine made with Swing is supposed to mimic the functionality of a real-life slot machine.<br>

<ul>
<li>1. Seven: 7</li>

<li>3. Watermelon: 5</li>
<li>4. Plum: 4</li>
<li>5. Lemon: 3</li>
<li>6. Cherry: 2</li>
</ul>

<p>Credit calculation works as follows:<br>
